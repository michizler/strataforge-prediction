# strataforge-prediction
StrataForge’s predictive analytics project modelling concrete compressive strength using regression and hypothesis testing. Explores how mix composition (cement, water, slag, age, superplasticizer) influences strength and fly-ash use—supporting cost optimisation, risk reduction, and data-driven construction decisions.
