## 2. The Situation

StrataForge operates its own batching plant and routinely experiments with concrete mix proportions to:

- Reduce material costs  
- Improve sustainability (using fly ash and slag)  
- Maintain or improve compressive strength  
- Meet client specifications  

Over two years, the materials testing lab accumulated **1,030 recorded mix trials**, each containing:

- Cement  
- Slag  
- Fly ash  
- Water  
- Superplasticizer  
- Coarse aggregate  
- Fine aggregate  
- Age (curing time)  
- Measured compressive strength  

The data was clean, complete, and entirely numeric — ideal for modelling.

But despite having this data, the business still relied on:

- Experience-based decision making  
- Conservative cement-heavy mixes  
- Trial-and-error adjustments  

This resulted in:

- Overuse of cement (high cost & carbon footprint)  
- Occasional strength failures during 28-day testing  
- Budget inefficiencies in procurement planning  
- Delays when mixes required redesign

## 3. The Business Risk

Concrete compressive strength is not just a technical metric. It drives:

- Structural safety compliance  
- Client approval milestones  
- Insurance liability  
- Project scheduling  
- Material procurement budgets  

When strength underperforms:

- Loads cannot be certified  
- Rework is required  
- Reputation risk increases  

When cement is overused to “guarantee” strength:

- Material cost inflates  
- Carbon targets suffer  
- Margins shrink  

StrataForge needed clarity.

## 4. The Analytics Initiative

The executive team commissioned a predictive modelling project with three objectives:

### Objective 1  
Quantify how mix components influence compressive strength.

### Objective 2  
Determine whether fly ash affects performance.

### Objective 3  
Create a strength prediction tool to support material optimisation and budgeting.
